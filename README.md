# Portfolio
My first time experimenting with bootstrap to make a personal website of mine. A pre-made layout was used. I tweaked it and added my own code and pictures.

Challenges:

Using my understanding of bootstrap columns and rows to tweak the layout. When I used the grid alone, I expected headings and content to be automatically centered. Instead I had to tweak it a bit.

Future editing:

-The projects that I will learn in class
-A link to my blog
